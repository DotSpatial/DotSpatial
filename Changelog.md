# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

Be aware that code written for 1.9 will not work out of the box because DotSpatial.Topology was replaced by DotSpatial.GeoAPI and DotSpatial.NetTopologySuite (#786). Have a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/DotSpatial/DotSpatial/wiki/Switching-from-DotSpatial-1.9-to-2.0) for more information.

### Added
- Aliases to Satellite of DotSpatial.Positioning
- Switched to NTS/GeoAPI instead of DotSpatial.Topology (#633, #404, #786) 
- Tag property in ActionItem (#338)
- Added property AppManager.BaseDirectory which allows to change base directory for plugins. (#758)
- Support for formatted ESRI projection files (#793)
- XML comments for publicly visible types and members
- "Add layer to Map"-checkbox to the ToolDialog (#147)
- CopySubset overloads with withAttributes parameters
- Jenks Natural Breaks support in categories binning.
- Test that checks correct creation of GpggkSentence objects from string
- Constructing Shapefiles in memory as single zip archives (#885)
- StyleCop.Analyzers to enforce a set of style and consistency rules
- Chm file with DotSpatial API documentation
- Example for Buffer.AddBuffer method (#1002)
- Legend.UseLegendForSelection property to be able to decide whether the legend should be used for selection or not. (#1008)
- Possibility to drag layers out of their group into the parent group (in legend) (#1008)
- Clear parameter to Select function to speed up drawing (#1024)
- LayoutControl.InitialOpenFileDirectory property that allows to set the folder that is shown in the OpenFileDialog that is used to open an existing layout
- FeatureLayer.Snappable to indicate whether the layer can be used for snapping
- The possibility to draw linestrings which are inside a geometry collection (#1061)
- The possibility to use static methods to deserialize objects that were serialized to a dspx file and can't be deserialized correctly via their class constructor (FeatureSet, MapSelfLoadGroup, MapSelfLoadLayers from GdalExtension, SpatiaLiteFeatureSet) (#1061)
- Default mouse cursor button in layout insert toolbar
- A function to get a reprojected clone of a featureset

### Changed
- Switched to VS2017 and C#7
- Switched to .Net Framework 4.5.2 (#1083)
- GdalExtension: Updated to GDAL 1.1.11
- Demo and Apps projects should have build files (#120)
- ExtensionManager & HideReleaseFromEndUser (#798)
- Moved localizeable strings to resource files
- Renamed FilterCollectionEM to FeatureSelectionExt because it contains extension methods for IFeatureSelection
- Move FeatureSet.Filename / FilePath to DataSet (#821)
- Changed Filename to absolute path so it stays the same even if CurrentDirectory is changed
- Renamed IntervalMethod.Quantile to IntervalMethod.EqualFrequency for better consistency.
- IHeaderControl.Add() now returns object which represents added GUI item.
- Added authority and authority code as optional parameters to method ProjectionInfo.FromProj4String.
- Update proj4 strings to EPSG db 9.0 (#870)
- ShapeFile Numeric columns now loaded into double instead of string for up to 15 decimal digits (#893)
- DS Feature refactorings (#906)
- LegendText ReadOnly (#750)
- Made Shapefile class abstract, because we already have FeatureSet for creating unspecified Shapefiles (#890)
- Moved MapFrame extension methods to Group (#1008)
- Drawing functions so selected features are drawn on top (#897)
- ShapeEditors AddFeature and MoveVertex functions, so they snap only to the layers that allow snapping
- ShapeEditors SnapSettingsDialog to allow the users to select the layers the editor functions may snap to
- If a dxf file contains points, lines and polygons at the same time, the dxf file gets added to the map as a group that contains one layer for points, one for lines and one for polygons (#1061)
- If a dxf file contains only a single feature type the dxf file gets added to the map as a single layer with the feature type it contains (#1061)
- dxf files get loaded with their styles (#1061)
- Show buttons from layout toolbars as checked while their function is active
- replaced ContextMenu by ContextMenuStrip inside Legend, so we don't have to draw the images shown in the ContextMenu ourselves (#1069)
- changed the background color of the LayerDialog and TabControlDialog tabs to Control so they have the same background color as the user controls they contain (#1069)

### Removed
- Removed DotSpatial.Topology assembly (#633)
- Removed obsolete methods\properties (#797)
- Removed DotSpatial.Mono assembly. Mono helper now is in DotSpatial.Data assembly.
