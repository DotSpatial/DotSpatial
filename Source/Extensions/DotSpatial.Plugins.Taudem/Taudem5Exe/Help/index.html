        <h1>
            Multicore Watershed Delineation</h1>
        Since version 4.8.2 MapWindow adopted version 5 of the <a href="http://hydrology.usu.edu/taudem/taudem5.0/index.html"
            target="_blank">TauDEM</a> software. TauDEM, <i>Terrain Analysis Using Digital Elevation
                Maps</i>, is the main component of the MapWindow <i>Watershed Delineation</i>
        plugin. </p>
        <p>
            TauDEM version 5 is designed for modern multicore architectures. A <i>multicore</i>
            CPU has more than one processor: 2, 4, even more. By using an implementation of
            the <i>Message Passing Interface</i> (MPI), TauDEM version 5 can take advantage
            of multiple cores, splitting tasks between them, and speeding up calculations. It
            is also able to process much bigger DEMs: up to 4GB.
        </p>
        <p>
            The implementation of MPI used by TauDEM is <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2/"
                target="_blank">MPICH2</a> from the Argonne National Laboratory in the USA.
            MPICH2 is free, open source software. It is a little tricky to install on Windows,
            and not all users will need it, so the approach adopted for MapWindow is as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>By default MPICH2 is not installed. TauDEM will run without it, in "single process"
                mode. </li>
            <li>You may obtain and install MPICH2, and we give some instructions below. Then MapWindow
                will discover that MPICH2's program manager is running, and will take advantage
                of it. There is no point in doing this unless you have a multicore CPU, and probably
                not much unless you have large DEMs. To give an example, on a dual-core machine
                I managed to get a reduction of just over 30% on the 36 minutes need to calculate
                the D8 flow directions for a DEM with 36 million cells. The best number of processes
                for this calculation was 8. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
            Installing MPICH2</h2>
        Note that you need to be an administrator to install MPICH2.
        <ul>
            <li>Download the installer from the MPICH2 <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2/"
                target="_blank">web site</a>. The current stable release for MPICH2 is 1.4.1. It
                was released on Aug. 24th, 2011. It is almost always advisable to choose the latest
                stable release. Get the 64-bit version if you have a 64-bit machine. </li>
            <li>MPICH2 supports multi-process computations across several machines. So you may get
                a Windows firewall query as to whether you want to allow the MPICH2 program manager,
                smpd, access to networks. Since TauDEM only runs multiple processes inside your
                machine you may <i>Keep Blocking</i> access (Windows XP) or <i>Cancel</i> access
                (Vista and Windows 7) (unless, of course, you are using MPICH2 for other purposes
                for which it needs network access).
                <img src="blockxp.jpg" alt="Blocking network access on Windows XP" width="434" height="312"
                    class="leftimage" />
                <img src="block7.jpg" alt="Blocking network access on Windows 7" width="437" height="312"
                    class="rightimage" />
                <br clear="all" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <img src="behappy7.jpg" alt="Supplying the secret word" width="513" height="420"
                    class="rightimage" />
                During installation you are asked for a <i>secret word</i> to be used for security
                in inter-machine communication. Again, for TauDEM you are not interested, so you
                can leave the default secret word of "behappy".
                <br clear="all" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <img src="path7.jpg" alt="Adding to the path" width="624" height="576" class="rightimage" />
                You need to add MPICH2's bin folder to your Path environment variable.
                <br />
                To do this, in Windows 7: select Start (the icon in the bottom left of your screen)
                -> Computer -> Properties -> Advanced System Settings -> Advanced -> Environment
                Variables -> Path (in System variables) -> Edit, and add <tt>;C:\Program Files\MPICH2\Bin</tt>
                to the end of the Path. (The initial ";" is the separator between entries.)
                <br />
                In Windows XP, select Start -> right click on My Computer -> Properties -> Advanced
                -> Environment Variables and then as in Windows 7.
                <br clear="all" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <img src="register7.jpg" alt="Supplying your password" width="677" height="342" class="rightimage" />
                You need to register a program <i>mpiexec</i>, supplying it with your login password.
                To do this you need to start a command window in administrator mode. In Windows
                7, select Start -> All Programs -> Accessories, right click on Command Prompt ->
                Run as Administrator. In Windows XP, select Start -> All Programs -> Accessories
                -> Command Prompt.
                <br />
                Then use the command<br />
                <tt>mpiexec -register</tt>
                <br />
                At the prompts supply your user name (or just hit Enter if the default is you) and
                then provide and confirm your login password. You need an administrator account
                with a password!
                <br clear="all" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <img src="mpicheck7.jpg" alt="Checking MPICH2" width="677" height="342" class="rightimage" />
                The moment has come to check all is well. In the same command window, cd to<br />
                <tt>C:\Program Files\MPICH2\examples</tt> and try the command
                <br />
                <tt>mpiexec -n 2 cpi</tt> cpi is a small program for calculating &pi;. As you can
                see, this failed the first time for me. I tried <tt>smpd -install</tt> which reinstalled
                the MPICH2 program manager smpd, and then I was able to run the cpi program with
                2 processes.
                <br />
                Now it is ready for use with MapWindow: installation is complete.
